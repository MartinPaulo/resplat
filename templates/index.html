### To do

* Node Connect Error Report
* IDs that were not successfully linked to a vicnode collection
* Collection by status
* UoM internal report showing total allocation, ingested and capacity
* View of each product
* Faculty breakdown graph as well showing each product
* Data Ingested split by 2 Digit FOR code
* Demographics report
* Add a persistent handle for each collection (DOI?)
* Remove label aliases...

### Done

* Bring new Collection profile into the Collection view
* Add old Collection Use – Interface information into new collection page
* Include an overall ingest graph with a link to another page that loads
  ingest history
* Ballarat University is now Federation University. Can we remove Ballarat?
* Under request there should be a drop down to associate the correct
  collection with the request.
* Total ingest over time – better graphs!
